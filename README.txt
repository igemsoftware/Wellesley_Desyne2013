ABOUT:

This repository contains the Wellesley Human-Computer Interaction Lab's official submission for iGEM 2013. 

Our submission contains three applications:

1. Eugenie, a collaborative multi-touch tool that implements top-down design of novel genetic circuits

2. zTree, an interactive 3D visualization of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts

3. Bac to the Future, a web application that aims to communicate synthetic biology concepts to non-scientists by simulating an interactive wet lab protocol
